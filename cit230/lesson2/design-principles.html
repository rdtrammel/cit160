                    <h4><a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/courses"    target="_blank">Interaction Design Foundation</a>

                    <p>The people at Interaction Design have a beautiful website. Their use of color to guide the user is very well done. Most of the content is in white space, is grouped well, and doesn't overwhelm you.</p>
                    <p>Then, all of the things that you can interact with, although a subdued baby blue color, come across very bold and obvious. It's very well done.</p>

                    <img src="images/apple.png" alt="example of apple using contrast">
                    <p>Apple has always had an exceptional design team. Their website is the first that comes to mind whenever I attempt to design anything. They've also published a design standard called the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/" target="_blank">Human Interface Guide</a> which makes sense when you read it.</p>

                    <p>Hick’s Law is a simple idea that says that the more choices you present your users with, the longer it will take them to reach a decision. It’s common sense, but often neglected in the rush to cram too much functionality into a site or application.</p>
                    <p style="text-align:left; padding-bottom:0px;">Co-Drops has a very simple design.</p>
