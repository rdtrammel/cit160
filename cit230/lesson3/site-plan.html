The site purpose should attempt to provide scope to the website in describing what services it provides. Typically students might leave this section lacking by not talking about perceived content</p>
                <h3>Why do people come to my website?</h3>
                <ol>

                <h2>Target Audience and Scenarios</h2>
                <p class="instructions">
                    <strong>Instructions: </strong>This section requires some research about the website visitors by looking into the purpose and the industry, visiting similar sites and preforming surveys to discover what scenarios are relevant to the visitor. Develop two personas (Links to an external site.) to describe the target audience for the weather site. This section should describe the target audience being judicious about the selection of the most plausible demographics.
                    <br><br>Some visitor demographic information to consider is age, income, education, experience with the topic and family status. Additional audience information would include where, when and how the visitor will be accessing the site. What device will they be using?
                </p>
                <h3>Target Audience</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Citizens</li>
                    <li>Travel Agents</li>

                </ol>

                <ol>
                    <li>Citizens who wake up to tumultuos noise and wind will most likely wonder to themselves, "What is going on out there?"</li>
                    <li>Citizens and Travel Agents will want to see what the weather is doing to ensure that a trip is safe to make.</li>
                    <li>Developers of other apps may also want to use your data to inform users of their apps in more specific ways and they may review your site to test reliability and to see what your website has that others do not.</li>
                    <li>School Administrators will want to make decisions on whether to close a school or not based on predicted outcomes in weather.</li>
                    <li>Age demographic will be anyone from the ages of 14 to 60. Demographics in the range of 60 and up still rely on traditional news sources.</li>

                <h2>Site Map</h2>
                <p class="instructions"><strong>Instructions: </strong>The site map is typically a sketch of all the pages and references on the site and is derived from the customer's functional specifications.  The hierarchical relationship is illustrated and will drive the site navigation and links. Depending on the project, these site maps can be complex. Note that the site map for the weather project is fairly simple and you wish to elaborate on some additional pages regardless of the given site description.</p>

                <h2>Color Scheme</h2>
                <p class="instructions">The color scheme refers to the carefully selected site colors that reflect the organization's purpose and trademark colors. The planning document defines the color scheme through a color palette that labels color style definitions and swatches for site elements.</p>

            <section id="typography">
                <h2>Typography</h2>
                <p class="instructions">The typography section of the planning document provides examples of the fonts to be used and where they are to be applied. You may wish to combine this section with the color scheme section as your provide application references in your plan. Be careful in your selection and use of typography as this critical design element is often overlooked and not tested in all views. Proper application of typography requires design and technical skills. You want to draw in the appropriate level of attention with your usable typography but no overwhelm, distract, nor confuse the user. The ultimate goal of typography, regardless of subjective opinions, is to properly communicate. This means you sometimes have to heed the prevailing wind of opinion which will still be safe in presenting readable text that presents a mood. In web design you can work with not only the font family, but also the size, line height and text measure or width.</p>
