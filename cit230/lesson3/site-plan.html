Even though we will not be obtaining/purchasing nor actually using this domain for the project, you will be required to research the domain name to check on its availability and cost. Use https://domains.google (Links to an external site.) or a domain registrar of your choice to research and obtain this information. The domain name must be available.</p>

                <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
                <p class="instructions"><strong>Instructions: </strong>The site purpose provides a statement about the purpose of the website drawing upon the client's functional specifications, the industry and any fictitious but viable goals that you deem to be reasonable for a community site that provides weather information. The site purpose should attempt to provide scope to the website in describing what services it provides. Typically students might leave this section lacking by not talking about perceived content</p>
                <h3>Why do people come to my website?</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>The weather is something that changes from moment to moment, so they want to go somewhere where they can get an answer quickly.</li>
                    <li>People come to this website because they are looking for a quick answer to the question, What is the weather doing today? </li>
                    <li>People also come to visit because they are looking for reliable information.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Target Audience and Scenarios</h2>
                <p class="instructions"><strong>Instructions: </strong>This section requires some research about the website visitors by looking into the purpose and the industry, visiting similar sites and preforming surveys to discover what scenarios are relevant to the visitor. Develop two personas (Links to an external site.) to describe the target audience for the weather site. This section should describe the target audience being judicious about the selection of the most plausible demographics.
                        <br><br>Some visitor demographic information to consider is age, income, education, experience with the topic and family status. Additional audience information would include where, when and how the visitor will be accessing the site. What device will they be using?</p>

            <section id="site-map">
                <h2>Site Map</h2>
                <p class="instructions"><strong>Instructions: </strong>The site map is typically a sketch of all the pages and references on the site and is derived from the customer's functional specifications.  The hierarchical relationship is illustrated and will drive the site navigation and links. Depending on the project, these site maps can be complex. Note that the site map for the weather project is fairly simple and you wish to elaborate on some additional pages regardless of the given site description.</p>
